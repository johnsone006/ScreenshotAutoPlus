# ScreenshotAutoPlus
This is a program that screenshots user-specified nif files by opening them in NifSkope, loading the view the user specified, and then saving the  screenshot to the user specified save folder. It also closes nifskope after each screenshot is saved.
Tips for best results:
1. This program relies on an open source program, called NifSkope. Make sure you have it on your machine. The version I use can be found here: https://github.com/niftools/nifskope.git
2. Make sure that either the Block List, Block Details, Header, Inspect, KFM, or Interactive Help is docked on the far *left* side of NifSkope prior to starting. If you don't, its possible that part of the mesh will be obscured in the screenshot.
3. If you aren't happy with the number of size options you get for each screenshot, you have a few options:
      - Make the viewport in NifSkope smaller by making the panels I mentioned in number 2 wider
      - Clear space on the drive of the save folder you picked.
      - Pick a different drive.
4. Unless you are trying to continue where you left off after pressing the cancel button, it is best to pick a save folder that is empty. If you are trying to pick up where you left off, make sure you pick the same save folder as before. Also, until all the screenshots are taken, its best to refrain from  changing the names of the screenshots or changing the extensions of any of the files. Same for the .nif files.
